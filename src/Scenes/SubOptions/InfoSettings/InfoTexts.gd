	[i]Supported Formats:[/i]
	
	Veles has different tiers of support for different fileformats when it comes to tagging and metadata changes.
	In this Infotext every supported fileformat will be highlighted and how you can change it's metadata.
	
	[i]MP3:[/i]
	
	The most common format for modern day music listeners is the MP3 format. Therefore, Veles fully supports it, by 
	integrating the official ID3 Tags, that allow you to:
	1.) Change Text Tags (Title, Artist, Comment,....)
	2.) Covers
	3.) Lyrics (Unsynched and Synched)
	
	Veles also uses some of the frames, which you can read about [url=https://id3.org/id3v2.3.0]HERE[/url].
	Some include:
		
	.) Popularimeter [POPM], to save Songratings
	.) Synchronised lyrics/text [SYLT], to save synched Lyrics
	.) Unsychronised lyrics/text transcription [USLT], to save unsynched lyrics
	It is my goal to add as many specific frames as possible to Veles to be able to organize your collection of mp3 files in the best ways possible.
	
	[i]OGG-VORBIS:[/i]
	
	Another very common format for playing music is the OGG-Vorbis format. 
	OGG-Vorbis uses the Xiph-Comment for it's metadata.
	Since, this format support for metadata inclusion in files is way more messy and less uniform across the world,
	the options in Veles are smaller compared to mp3 files.
	1.) Change Text Tags (Title, Artist, Comment,....)
	2.) Covers
	
	For the time Being Veles has no support for Lyrics or any other type of metdata, except for the two above.
	
	[i]WAV / RIFF WAVE:[/i]
	
	Even though the need for tagging on .wav files may be disputed, Veles still supports it by integrating the ID3 type tags.
	1.) Change Text Tags (Title, Artist, Comment,....)
	2.) Covers
	3.) Lyrics (Unsynched and Synched)
	
	[i]FLAC:[/i]
	
	The FLAC format is a favourite among music enthusiasts, since it has the positives of mp3 files while having lossless compression.
	1.) Change Text Tags (Title, Artist, Comment,....)
	2.) Covers
	
	[i]Other Formats:[/i]
	
	Each of the now specified music formats simply support the setting of simple text tags.
	
	1.) APE
	2.) ASF
	3.) OGG-OPUS
	4.) OGG-SpeeX
	5.) S3M
	6.) WAVPACK / WV
	7.) XM
	8.) TrueAudio
	9.) MPC
	""",
	"Multitagging" : 
"""
	[i]Multitagging:[/i]

	By either adding multiple songs or selecting multiple songs on a playlist using the SHIFT-Key,
	Veles will allow you to tag multiple songs at the same time.
	This will be done by overwriting the tags of all the selected songs with the same tags.
	The Displayed Cover and Text Tags will be from the first selected song.
