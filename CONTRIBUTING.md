# General
First, any contribution of any size size is greatly appreciated by me, 
be it a small bugfix, a new feature, quality life improvement or something as simple as fixing a typo.

# Bug Reports
If you found a bug while using Veles you can open a pull request.
If you find multiple bugs separate them each in multiple pull requests.

# Feature Request
When you're thinking of a feature that is not in Veles and can be useful 
to improve the general user experienceor just would be cool feature for users,
you can also enter a pull request with that request and it may be added in the future.
When doing such a request please commit the time to:
1. Explain your Idea
2. Reason why Veles needs this specific feature
3. Propose a way of including that feature within your capability

# Contributing
